# Introduction

The backend for my Singapore michelin guide application. I might want to revisit this project in future. For now, perfect is the enemy of good.

# Personal Objectives

The focus of this project was to hone my frontend skills. So, in using packages and tools I was already familiar with, I don't think I learnt much, other than deepening my familiarity with these packages and tools.

Fun fact: Did you know that [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) does type coersion? Let me tell you, it wasn't fun finding that out :p
